Resource
========


Description
-----------
A file or set of files required by an experiment.  All resource files are
copied, along with the experiment file itself, to the system running
MWServer.

*Note*:  In the absence of resource declarations, the MWorks parser
infers the required resources from the ``path`` and ``directory_path``
attributes of other components.  However, if the experiment declares
any resources, then this inference step is skipped.  Hence, an experiment
that declares any resources must include *all* required files in its
resource declarations.



Signature
---------
``resource``


Required Parameters
-------------------

path
^^^^
:Examples: ``images/1.png``, ``sounds``, ``/shared/imagesets/01/``

Filesystem path to the required file or directory.  If a directory, all non-hidden, regular files in the directory are copied, including those in nested subdirectories.
