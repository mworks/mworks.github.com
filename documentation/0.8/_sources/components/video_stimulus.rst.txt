.. _Video Stimulus:

Video Stimulus
==============


Description
-----------
A stimulus that plays a video stored in any `video file format
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_file_format>`_ supported by the
operating system.

*Note*:  To preserve the video's aspect ratio on screen, `x_size`_ and
`y_size`_ must be equal.  When drawn, the larger dimension spans the full
specified size, while the smaller dimension is scaled to maintain the
aspect ratio.



Signature
---------
``stimulus/video``


Required Parameters
-------------------

path
^^^^

Filesystem path to the video file



Optional Parameters
-------------------

volume
^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Output audio volume (floating-point value between 0 and 1, where 0 is muted and 1 is full system volume)


loop
^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the video will repeat indefinitely (or until `Stop Dynamic Stimulus` is invoked)


repeats
^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0``

Number of times to repeat the video.  Note that the video will always
play at least once, even if this value is less than one.

If `loop`_ is ``YES``, this parameter is ignored.


ended
^^^^^

Variable that will be set to true after the video ends.  If `repeats`_ is greater than 1, the variable will be set only once, after all repetitions are complete.  If `loop`_ is ``YES``, the variable will never be set.


x_size
^^^^^^
:Example: ``5.0``

Horizontal size (degrees).

If omitted, the value of `y_size`_ is used.  It is an error to omit both
x_size and y_size (unless `fullscreen`_ is ``YES``).


y_size
^^^^^^
:Example: ``5.0``

Vertical size (degrees).

If omitted, the value of `x_size`_ is used.  It is an error to omit both
x_size and y_size (unless `fullscreen`_ is ``YES``).


x_position
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Horizontal center position (degrees)

y_position
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Vertical center position (degrees)

rotation
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``0.0``

Rotation (degrees)

alpha_multiplier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``1.0``

Controls the transparency of the stimulus.  ``1.0`` is fully opaque, while ``0.0`` is fully tranparent.


fullscreen
^^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the stimulus is sized to fill the display.  In this mode, `x_size`_, `y_size`_, `x_position`_, `y_position`_, and `rotation`_ are ignored.


deferred
^^^^^^^^
:Options: ``no``, ``yes``, ``explicit``
:Default: ``no``

Controls when the stimulus is loaded.  If ``no``, the stimulus is loaded at experiment load time.  If ``yes``, the stimulus is loaded the first time it is `queued <Queue Stimulus>`.  If ``explicit``, the stimulus must be loaded explictly with `Load Stimulus`.


autoplay
^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the stimulus will start playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Play Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `queued <Queue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` has been invoked.  It will also stop playing automatically (as if by an implicit `Stop Dynamic Stimulus` action) after it has been `dequeued <Dequeue Stimulus>` and `Update Stimulus Display` is invoked.
