Optional Parameters
-------------------

running

Variable to set to true when the LED program starts running, false when it stops


temp_a
^^^^^^

Variable in which to store thermistor readout from bank A (reported in degrees Celsius)


temp_b

autostart
^^^^^^^^^
:Default: ``NO``

If ``YES``, the device will start I/O automatically (as if by an
implicit `Start IO Device` action) when the experiment starts running.

*Note*: Device I/O will always stop automatically when the experiment
stops running, irrespective of this setting.


alt
^^^

Alternative device to use if this one fails to initialize (e.g. because the required hardware is not available).  If ``#allowAltFailover`` is set to 0 or false, this parameter is ignored.
