EyeLink Device
==============


Description
-----------
Digital interface to an `EyeLink <http://www.sr-research.com>`_
eye tracker.  Tested with the
`EyeLink 1000 <http://www.sr-research.com/eyelink1000.html>`_ and
`EyeLink II <http://www.sr-research.com/eyelinkII.html>`_ trackers,
but may be compatible with additional devices.

If the tracker is run in binocular mode, `eye_x`_, `eye_y`_, and `eye_z`_
give the midpoint of the shortest connecting line that is orthogonal to both
gaze vectors; otherwise, these values will be empty.  All other output
parameters are specified and described in the `EyeLink 1000 User Manual
<file:///Applications/Eyelink/docs/EyeLink1000_UserManual.pdf>`_.



Signature
---------
``iodevice/eyelink``


Required Parameters
-------------------

tracker_ip
^^^^^^^^^^
:Example: ``10.1.1.2``

The tracker's IP address

tracking_dist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Example: ``1024``

Tracking range in eye tracker units.  (The default value should be 1024.)


data_interval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:Example: ``1ms``

Data polling interval.  Should not be too short, but faster than tracker's sampling rate.




Optional Parameters
-------------------

eye_rx
^^^^^^

Variable in which to store right eye screen gaze x

eye_ry
^^^^^^

Variable in which to store right eye screen gaze y

eye_lx
^^^^^^

Variable in which to store left eye screen gaze x

eye_ly
^^^^^^

Variable in which to store left eye screen gaze y

eye_x
^^^^^

Variable in which to store computed ``eye_x`` (described above)

eye_y
^^^^^

Variable in which to store computed ``eye_y`` (described above)

eye_z
^^^^^

Variable in which to store computed ``eye_z`` (described above)

href_rx
^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store right eye headref x

href_ry
^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store right eye headref y

href_lx
^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store left eye headref x

href_ly
^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store left eye headref y

pupil_rx
^^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store right eye pupil x

pupil_ry
^^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store right eye pupil y

pupil_lx
^^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store left eye pupil x

pupil_ly
^^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store left eye pupil y

pupil_size_r
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store right pupil size or area

pupil_size_l
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store left pupil size or area

eye_time
^^^^^^^^

Variable in which to store time of sample (on EyeLink clock)

alt
^^^

Alternative device to use if this one fails to initialize (e.g. because the required hardware is not available).  If ``#allowAltFailover`` is set to 0 or false, this parameter is ignored.
