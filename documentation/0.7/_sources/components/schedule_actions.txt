Schedule Actions
================


Description
-----------
Schedule the execution of a list of contained actions.  These actions can be scheduled to occur after a user-defined delay and can be repeated multiple times with a user-defined inter-execution interval.



Signature
---------
``action/schedule``


Required Parameters
-------------------

delay
^^^^^

Initial delay before first execution (microseconds)

duration
^^^^^^^^

Delay before each execution after the first (microseconds)

repeats
^^^^^^^

Number of times to repeat execution.  The special value ``-999`` causes execution to repeat indefinitely (until the experiment stops or `cancel`_ is set to true).




Optional Parameters
-------------------

cancel
^^^^^^

If set to the name of a variable, assigning a true value (e.g. ``true``, ``YES``, ``1``) to that variable will cancel all future executions of the contained actions
