# Source for the MWorks Project Website #

This repository contains the source for the MWorks project website, which is automatically converted by GitHub into a static site via [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

If you wish to view the actual, live site, please go [here](http://mworks-project.org/).

## Local testing ##

To test changes to the MWorks website locally, [install Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) on your machine, `cd` to the top level of this repository, and run

    bundle exec jekyll serve

You can then [visit the test site](http://localhost:4000/) to verify your changes before publishing.
