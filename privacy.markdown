## Privacy Policy ##

The MWorks applications (MWClient, MWServer, and MWEditor on macOS; the MWorks app on iOS) do not collect any user data.  Data files generated by experiments are stored locally on the device and are never transmitted anywhere by the MWorks applications.

### Network Usage ###

When MWClient connects to an MWServer instance running on a different macOS system, or to the MWorks app running on an iOS device, it communicates via unencrypted TCP/IP connections.  The security of the data sent via these connections therefore depends on the security of the network over which they travel.  If the intervening network is open to the public Internet or otherwise insecure, the data transmitted between MWorks applications may be intercepted and collected by a third party.

### Third-Party Services ###

The MWorks website, including the online user manual, is hosted on GitHub.  You can view GitHub's privacy policy at

MWorks uses the Tender web service to provide user support.  You can view Tender's privacy policy at
