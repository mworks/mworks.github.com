title: Graphics issues in Yosemite
author: cstawarz

Just a quick heads up:  There seem to be some graphics performance issues in [OS X 10.10 (Yosemite)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Yosemite).  I'm still trying to determine whether these problems are due to a bug in the new OS and, if not, what we need to do to address them.  In the meantime, I recommend *not* upgrading any production machines until these issues are resolved.
