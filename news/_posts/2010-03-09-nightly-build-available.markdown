For those interested in trying out the latest MWorks code, an [installer
package](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mworks-downloads/nightly/MWorks-NIGHTLY.dmg)
is now available.  For installation instructions, please see [Installing
MWorks](https://mworks.tenderapp.com/kb/installation/install-mworks).

The installer is automatically built and tested every night, using the
latest (HEAD) source code.  Since it represents the bleeding edge of
the MWorks code base, it should *not* be used by anyone looking for a
stable release.
