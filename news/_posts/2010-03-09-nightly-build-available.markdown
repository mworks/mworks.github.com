For those interested in trying out the latest MWorks code, an
[installer
package](http://dicarlo-mwdev.mit.edu/mw/MWorks-NIGHTLY.dmg) is now
available.  For installation instructions, please see [Installing
MWorks](http://help.mworks-project.org/kb/installation/install-mworks).

The installer is automatically built and tested every night, using the
latest (HEAD) source code.  Since it represents the bleeding edge of
the MWorks code base, it should *not* be used by anyone looking for a
stable release.
