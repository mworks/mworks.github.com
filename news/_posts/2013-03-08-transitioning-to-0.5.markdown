title: Transitioning to 0.5
author: cstawarz

In order to help folks transition to MWorks 0.5, I've posted two short guides on the MWorks [support site](http://help.mworks-project.org/).

First, all users should have a look at ["Upgrading to 0.5"](http://help.mworks-project.org/kb/installation/upgrading-to-05), which describes some minor changes you may need to make to your experiments.

Second, plugin developers should read ["Updating plugins for 0.5"](http://help.mworks-project.org/kb/development/updating-plugins-for-05), which explains the changes required to make plugins (core and client) compatible with MWorks 0.5.

If you have any questions or need additional assistance, please [start a discussion](http://help.mworks-project.org/discussion/new).
