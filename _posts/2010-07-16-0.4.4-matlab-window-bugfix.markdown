title: Fix for 0.4.4 MATLAB window problems
---

We recently
[discovered](http://help.mworks-project.org/discussions/problems/8)
that the MATLAB client window shipped with MWorks 0.4.4 contains a
couple show-stopping bugs.

If you've installed MWorks 0.4.4 and plan on using the MATLAB window,
you should download the [bugfix
installer](http://github.com/downloads/mworks-project/mw_suite/MWorksMATLABWindow-0.4.4-bugfix2.zip).
After unpacking the zip file, run the script `Install.command` (double
click the icon in the Finder) to install the fixed MATLAB window.

If you don't use the MATLAB window, you can ignore all this.

As always, please report any problems on the [support
site](http://help.mworks-project.org/discussion/new).
