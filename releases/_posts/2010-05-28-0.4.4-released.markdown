### Release Notes ###


#### General

* Project name changed from "MonkeyWorks" to "MWorks" in recognition
  of its successful application to non-monkey experimental subjects
* MWorks now requires Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and won't run on
  earlier versions of Mac OS X
* Source repositories now hosted on GitHub
* Support files (configuration, plugins, Python and MATLAB interfaces,
  examples, development headers and libraries) are now stored in
  `/Library/Application Support/MWorks`
* Data files and saved variables are now stored in the user's home
  directory (in `~/Documents/MWorks`)
* Applications' "About" dialogs now show both the release version
  number and a git commit ID
* Installer now offers to back up existing installation; "Uninstall
  MWorks" script can remove new installation and restore old one


#### Core

* Streamlined IODevice base class.  Old base class still available as
  LegacyIODevice.
* Fixed bug that could cause client's memory usage to steadily grow
  over time
* Properly exit full-screen mode when releasing displays
* Support both user-level and system-level MWorks config file
* Fixed various memory bugs
* Fix for external display flicker under OS X 10.6.3
* Reduced excess state announcements during spinning transitions
* FIXED: Selection variables were being assigned incorrect (and
  already used) codec codes
* Handle mangled incoming codec data safely
* Event-handling refactoring; new object hierarchy allows for less
  code duplication and more flexibility
* Widespread naming and factoring changes
* Name change: task_mode -> state_system_mode
* Changes to ensure that setup variables are correctly loaded from the
  correct component registry
* More intelligent parsing of report strings with variable
  substitutions
* Greatly speeded up experiment parsing for very large experiments
* Added basic deferred stimulus loading capabilities
* Fixed a problem where the server would crash if a stimulus group
  name was not found
* Fixed problem with alpha_multiplier not working
* Better parser error handling
* Fixed a problem where objects weren't being looked up ever by their
  tag names â€“ caused problems for replicated stimuli with
  replicate-wise tag names


#### Server

* Croak if more than one plugin tries to define a factory with the
  same XML signature
* Tag console messages with time interval since server startup
* "Scroll to bottom on message" now actually scrolls console window
  all the way to the bottom


#### Client

* Improved experiment file selector
* List recent experiments from most to least recent
* Don't crash when "Load" is pressed with no experiment selected


#### Editor

* Added deferred property to image stimuli
* Added custom inspectors for Start/Stop IO and Report actions


#### Core Plugins

* Improved performance of DriftingGratingStimulus (no longer spawns 60
  threads per second)
* MovieStimulus: Prevent crash when attempting to stop an
  already-stopped movie
* FIXED: MSSWGamepad was reporting left trigger presses via the
  trigger_right variable (and vice versa)
* NEW: Xcode project template for core plugin


#### Python Tools

* NEW: Python bindings for data file indexer/reader
* NEW: Python bridge client plugin


#### MATLAB Tools

* Client window and data tools now support both 32- and 64-bit MATLAB
